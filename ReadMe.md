This is my IA3 for year 12 digital solutions, this project started 13/05/2024 and is ongoing. 
This application will manage Customer, Appointment, and Pet data using the supplied OurAPI as a database to call data from.
This is fully coded in python and uses the PyQt5 Tools Designer for its GUI.
The purpose for this repo is to document my progress and give possible inspiration for others who complete this assesment in the coming years.
